Things I tried to detect candidates for Adaboost
1. Detect circles using imfindcircles then use a calibrated window around it
	- failed because not all heads are circular
2. Detect shapes then put those shapes in a window which we run Adaboost on
	- No
3. Find clusters of like colors using k-means cluster.  Apply a laplacian filter to the image.
